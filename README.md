## About The Project

This project looks at creating a web app with the ability to add new records, send notifications on app activity and also view data from the DynamoDB. Our team was tasked to recommend 2 solutions for this app and design 1 out of the 2. For the development of this app we opted for the severless architecture.

### Collaborations

This is a hand-on cloud engineering project delivered by the Azubi Africa Cloud Team(Team Agile) in 2023. After 6 months of AWS cloud training and front-end development, we got a chance to work on some realife cloud projects.
